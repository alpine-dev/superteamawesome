For the lazy with a Mac and MAMP installed:

Run the following commands:

./setup.sh
./run.sh


For the non lazy or non macs or non MAMP-installers:

To run, first run npm install (may need sudo), and then run npm start.
You might need to install nodemon (npm install --global nodemon) first.

To dev, you'll need to install gulp (npm install --global gulp) and run gulp to compile the scss files

npm start will auto compile the jsx and bundle all the js into a bundle.js in public/js
